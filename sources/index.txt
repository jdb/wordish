Wordish documentation
=====================

.. automodule:: wordish

Reader's guide
--------------

#. Administrators will find more details in the pages :ref:`write` and
   :ref:`test`,

#. Anyone curious of how *Wordish* is designed may be interested in the
   :ref:`interfaces`.

#. For the brave Python developper impatient to propose a feature
   patch, a bug report and a fix, the page :ref:`sources`, and the
   page describing the :ref:`testsuite` and the :ref:`buildchain` will
   be helpful.

   The author of these lines must say that he found there are many
   ways to do *unit testing* and *packaging* and he would be grateful
   for the reader's advice and response to the many existential
   questions listed :ref:`here <testsuitequestions>` and
   :ref:`here <testbuildchain>`
