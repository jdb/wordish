"""
The *Wordish* modules declares three central classes: 

- the :class:`BlockFilter` which, given a directive, filters
  restructured text marked with the directive,

- the :class:`ShellSessionParser` which splits a shell session log into
  commands and outputs,

- and the :class:`CommandRunner` which spawns a shell subprocess, and
  to which the parsed commands are sent for execution,

The :func:`wordish` function, which is the main entry point of the script,
requires a file descriptor *f* argument describing a shell session in
a restructured text article. A simplified version of :func:`wordish`
boils down to::

  filter = BlockFilter( directive='sourcecode', arg=['sh'] )
  with CommandRunner() as run:
      for cmd, expected in ShellSessionParser( filter( f ) ):
          if run( cmd ) != expected:
              print "Warning: unexpected command %s 's output"

*Wordish* also declares two additional classes:

- The :class:`Reporter` formats the parsed commands and output,
  accumulates the success and failures, and formats a report in the
  end.

- The :class:`CommandOutput` is used to model the ouput of a shell
  command: the message printed on stdout, the message printed on
  stderr, and the return code. The :meth:`CommandRunner.__call__`
  method output instances of this class.

  A *CommandOutput* can be compared to a simple string, with the '=='
  syntax (as in the example above), in which case, only the stdout
  message is used for the comparison.

The :func:`wordish` function articulates the five classes::

    report = TestReporter()
    filter = BlockFilter(directive='sourcecode', arg=['sh'])

    with CommandRunner() as run:
        for cmd, expected in ShellSessionParser( filter(f) ):
            print report.before(cmd, expected)

            out = run(cmd)

            print report.success(out) if out == expected else report.failure(out)

            if out.aborted(): 
                print("there was a serious error: bailing out")
                break
